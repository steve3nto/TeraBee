# TeraBee + Arduino Music
Applications of Teraranger Multiflex sensors for computer music and music interaction. 
Developed for the hackathon in creative computing at Politecnico di Milano, during MSc courses of music and acoustic engineering.

Arduino + Teraranger Multiflex sensors to build a MIDI controller designed with singers and vocal performers in mind.
The hardcoded parameters (presets) were chosen and tested using an Eventide H9 multiFX.
